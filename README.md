# DeepLearningAlgorithms

These files are not an implementation of a whole project. However, these files shows how to use tensorflow from a beginner to an advance or difficult level.

The parts number shows the difficulty.

The greater the number, means more difficulty. I have covered all of the neural networks:CNN,RNN and FFNN. , Please note that the work for this rep is both in Tensor Flow 1.0 and Tensorflow 2.0


Moreover, the code files are my journey of learning tensorflow and deep learning,therefore I have not named files but numbered them therefore treat this rep as someone's journey into the world of deep learning.


The Opencv folder was used in conjuction with the later part of my code files.
